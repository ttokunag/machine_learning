# Machine Learning
I store all my personal and collaborative Data Science/Machine Learning projects.
Followings are explanation on each project:

## NYC Taxi Fare Prediction
I created machine learning model with linear regression to predict taxi fee amounts in NYC. I cleaned datasets with Pandas, then I visualized the relationship between pickup/drop-off locations and an actual NYC map using Matplotlib and Basemap. Finally, I created machine learning model with scikit-learn and visualized the model.<br><br>

## UCSD Final Project
I stored a notebook which I develop through Math-Computer Science class at University of California, San Diego. In the project, I treated various interesting topics including image compression, principal components analysis(PCA), and so on.

## Recent Graduates
I implemented a data analysis on relationships among college majors, gender difference and earnings of universities in the United States. I compared each college major feature with Python libraries such as NumPy and matplotlib and made a conclusion about what causes high salaries or gender unbalance based on the analysis.
