This repository contains all of Data Science/Machine Learning related projects. These projects are derived from my programming competition projects, school projects, and my curiosity.

### `NYC Taxi Fare Prediction`
I created machine learning model with linear regression to predict taxi fee amounts in NYC. I cleaned datasets with Pandas, then I visualized the relationship between pickup/drop-off locations and an actual NYC map using Matplotlib and Basemap. Finally, I created machine learning model with scikit-learn and visualized the model.

One of the hardest works in this project is getting rid of invalid points, which actually correspond taxi pick-up/drop-off locations, in the ocean.

### `UCSD Final Project`
I stored a notebook which I developed through Math-Computer Science class at University of California San Diego. In this project, I treated various interesting topics including image compression, principal components analysis(PCA), and so on. I also use this notebooks to teach my CS tutees concepts of Math theories.<br/><br/>

### `Recent Graduates`
I implemented a data analysis on relationships among college majors, gender difference and earnings of universities in the United States. I compared each college major feature with Python libraries such as NumPy and matplotlib and made a conclusion about what causes high salaries or gender unbalance based on the analysis.
