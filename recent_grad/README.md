## Recent Graduates

This repository contains a project about relations of university students' majors and students jobs after graduation, incomes, in-major gender-balance, unemployment rate, and so forth. The topic is pretty close to me as a student, and the result is very close to what people expect. However, readers may understand what factors lead to the result.
