# UCSD Final Project
### Tomoya Tokunaga (mailto: ttokunag@ucsd.edu)

This repository contains a project which was assigned as a final project in Data Science course at UCSD.
I worked on this project all by myself, and upload it in order to share how we can combine math knowledges and Computer Science.<br/><br/>
If the notebook cannot be loaded or loaded slowly, the following is the HTML version of the notebook.<br>
http://ttoku.com/Final_project.html<br/><br/>
The followings are materials this project covers:
- Matrix Determinants
- Paley Graph/Construction & Hadamard Determinant Bound
- Data Cleaning
- Minimu Spanning Trees
- Image Compression with Singular Value Decomposition
- Machine Learning (SVM + PCA)
